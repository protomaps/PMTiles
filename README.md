# PMTiles

PMTiles is a single-file archive format for tiled data. A PMTiles archive can be hosted on a commodity storage platform such as S3, and enables low-cost, zero-maintenance map applications that are "serverless" - free of a custom tile backend or third party provider.

* [PMTiles Viewer](https://pmtiles.io) - inspect and preview PMTiles local or remote PMTiles archives.
    * Archives on cloud storage may require CORS for the origin `https://protomaps.github.io`

[PMTiles on Cloudflare Workers](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles/tree/main/serverless/cloudflare)

## Recipes

Example of how to create a PMTiles archive from the [Census Bureau Zip Code Tabulation Areas Shapefile](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) using [tippecanoe](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe):

```sh
    # use GDAL/OGR to convert SHP to GeoJSON
    ogr2ogr -t_srs EPSG:4326 cb_2018_us_zcta510_500k.json cb_2018_us_zcta510_500k.shp
    # Creates a layer in the vector tiles named "zcta"
    tippecanoe -zg --projection=EPSG:4326 -o cb_2018_us_zcta510_500k_nolimit.pmtiles -l zcta cb_2018_us_zcta510_500k.json
```

### Uploading to Storage

Using the [PMTiles command line tool](http://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles):

```sh
pmtiles upload LOCAL.pmtiles "s3://BUCKET_NAME?endpoint=https://example.com&region=region" REMOTE.pmtiles
```

Using [RClone](https://rclone.org) (do `rclone config` first)

```sh
rclone copyto LOCAL.pmtiles r2:/BUCKET/REMOTE.pmtiles --progress --s3-chunk-size=256M --s3-upload-concurrency=2
```
